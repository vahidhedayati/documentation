# genpatch.sh will generate an eclipse based patch for a grails based project grails 2(on eclipse / ggts / sts )
# ready to go and fit in from two destination folders
# currently generates a patch for Mercurial based SVNs
#
# The scenario you have your code base. You have maybe additional patches that are required 
# for this to work but those patches not checked in so in effect your current work exported
# as patch would also include those other patches.
#
# To generate a specific patch between the point of the other patches vs this content the steps are:
# step 1 : Export patch including your current work and all the other patches imported as part of it
# step 2 : Only Import the existing patches that this patch requires. 
# step 3: Copy the folder / or maybe entire base app folder with those patches to a new destination.
#       In this example all I needed as the grails-app folder
#  >> Now using tortoise or however it is clean up the code base back to how it was.

# step 4:  import step1  -- This should now include your latest changes and all the other patches.
# step 5: Now copy the entire app folder in this case the grails-app folder which now includes the latest changes into another folder.
#    I now have:
#     /tmp/makepatch/grails-app 
#     /tmp/makepatch/latest/grails-app
#    The first folder contains step 3 copied folder 
#    The 2nd folder within makepatch called latest contains grails-app from step5
# genpatch.sh --grailsapp /tmp/makepatch/ /tmp/makepatch/latest/ -o /path/to/mypatch.patch
# genpatch.sh --grailsapp --src --verbose --jscss --ddl /tmp/makepatch/grails-app /tmp/makepatch/latest/grails-app -o /path/to/mypatch.patch
# genpatch.sh --gsjd /tmp/makepatch/grails-app /tmp/makepatch/latest/grails-app -o /path/to/mypatch.patch
# When defining the above options you are telling this script which folders to make a patch out of between those two folders in my case
# I copied just grails-app folder so if I do as above
# genpatch.sh --grailsapp /tmp/makepatch/grails-app /tmp/makepatch/latest/grails-app -o /path/to/mypatch.patch
# it tells script to find grails-app in the given folder and make a patch which forks perfectly since i know that is only changes 
# if it was all over the other segments then copy entire folder and include which bits to check
